# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — short documents
capturing a significant decision, its context, and its consequences.

Each ADR is `NNNN-kebab-title.md` with a monotonically increasing number. A
record is **Accepted** once merged; supersede it with a new ADR rather than
rewriting history (mark the old one `Superseded by NNNN`).
